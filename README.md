# Commonly used algorithms

1. <em>Two Pointer Technique:<em> This is often used to find subarrays or pairs in an array that meet specific conditions. It's efficient and can be applied to problems involving sliding windows.

2. <em>Binary Search:<em> Used for quickly finding elements in a sorted array or solving problems that involve searching in a sorted space.

3. <em>Dynamic Programming:<em> Many problems can be solved more efficiently by breaking them down into smaller overlapping subproblems and caching the results.

4. <em>Greedy Algorithms:<em> These are often used for optimization problems, where you make a series of choices that seem best at the moment but may not guarantee an optimal solution.

5. <em>DFS (Depth-First Search) and BFS (Breadth-First Search):<em> These are fundamental for graph traversal and are used in various graph-related problems.

6. <em>Dijkstra's Algorithm:<em> Great for finding the shortest path in weighted graphs when all edge weights are non-negative.

7. <em>Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:<em> Used for finding the shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a weighted graph.

8. <em>Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Data Structure:<em> Useful for maintaining disjoint sets and is often used in problems involving connected components.

9. <em>Segment Tree:<em> An efficient data structure for range queries and updates on an array. It's useful for problems that involve finding the maximum, minimum, sum, or other operations over a range of elements.

10. <em>Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree):<em> Another data structure for efficient range queries and updates, especially for problems involving cumulative sums.

11. <em>Topological Sorting:<em> Helps in solving problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), like scheduling tasks or resolving dependencies.

12. <em>Prime Sieve (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes):<em> Used for quickly generating prime numbers.

13. <em>Backtracking:<em> A technique for solving problems by trying out different possibilities and undoing them if they don't lead to a solution.

14. <em>Knapsack Algorithms:<em> Useful for solving problems involving resource allocation or optimization.

15. <em>Bipartite Graph Checking Algorithm:<em> Determines if a graph can be divided into two sets such that no two vertices within the same set are adjacent.

16. <em>Mo's Algorithm:<em> An offline query algorithm used to process range queries efficiently.

17. <em>Sparse Table:<em> Another data structure used for answering range queries on static arrays.

18. <em>Kruskal's and Prim's Algorithms:<em> Both used for finding minimum spanning trees in graphs.

19. <em>Suffix Arrays and Suffix Trees:<em> Used in string processing and pattern matching problems.

20. <em>Trie (Prefix Tree):<em> A tree-like data structure used for efficient string searches.
